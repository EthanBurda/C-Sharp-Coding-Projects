Repo for C# Large projects

Twenty One - The Twenty One (Blackjack) project was a very fun and eye opening experience. This is a console application game done in C# in Visual Studio. When playing this game it welcomes the user then asks for their name, money they have to play, how much they would like to bet on the first hand. It then continues to give the users cards and the dealer cards with the option to hit or stay with some built in safeguards. For example, the dealer cant hit after they have reached a certain number. Check it out and tell me what you think!
